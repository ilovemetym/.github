# helluva windy day
# sore eyes
# hella thoughts
# f it we ball
# anywho
# i'm really creating MeTym to help me solve my own problems
# with life
# and i hope that it will eventually
# help other people with theirs as well :)
# if some day someone says "I love MeTym!"
# that will put a smile on my face :)
# a wide smile
# because then i will know that i played a part in making the world a better place
# by helping them make their life...better
# for lack of a better word
# no pun intended
# let me start by writing a simple program to say "I love MeTym!"

# metym.py
class MeTym:
  say: str

  def __init__(self):
    self.say = 'I love MeTym!'

  def __call__(self):
    print(self.say)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  metym = MeTym()
  metym()

# hopefully some day it will be real person saying it :)
